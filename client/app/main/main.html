    <h1><img src="assets/images/shan.png" class="profpic"> Hi, my name is Shan!</h1>
    <p class="lead">I graduated from <a href="http://stuy.enschool.org/">Stuyvesant</a> and am currently studying Computer Engineering at <a href="http://www.villanova.edu/">Villanova</a>. As of now, the curriculum has not seriously started teaching Computer Engineering yet, so my main skills are still front-end web development and general programming in Python. I am looking for an internship or a job to both teach me more skills in programming and allow me to be exposed to the industry so I would be prepared coming out of college. I am up for any kind of software development internship, especially front-end web work, so let me know if there is a spot I can fill.
