    <p class="lead">Some call me Shan the Man, some call me Shannyface. Either way, I graduated from <a href="http://stuy.enschool.org/">Stuyvesant</a> and am curently studying Computer Engineering at <a href="http://www.villanova.edu/">Villanova</a>. Until I start learning signal processing and microprocessors, though, my main skillsets rest within the realm of web development.
