    <p class="lead">I graduated from <a href="http://stuy.enschool.org/">Stuyvesant</a> and am currently studying Computer Engineering at <a href="http://www.villanova.edu/">Villanova</a>. I am graduating one year early, so I am looking for a job coming straight out of college in May. I have a strong background in full stack web development in SQL, Mongodb, PHP, Node.js, Backbone.js, and Socket.io, and I also have a growing background in low-level computing skills in C, C++, and various assemblies.
